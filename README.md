# Lunchbox-CPU

-----------------------------------------------------------

##Description

----------------------------------

This project runs face recognition on live video from a picam using Raspberry Pi B+ and OpenCV. It does all of this while in a Avenegers tin kids lunchbox. 
The idea of putting a computer in a kids lunchbox stemmed from wanting people to least expect it. No one would ever think about someone having a computer
in their lunchbox.

### Things You Need & Putting the Lunchbox-CPU Together

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here are a list of things you will need in order to accomplish this whole project:

- Raspberry Pi B+
- 7inch 1024*600 LCD Module Screen Display for Raspberry Pi 3 B+(ali express $35)
- Tin kids lunchbox
-  Pi camera (Amazon $12.99)
- Bluetooth Keyboard (Amazon 14.99) Make sure it is small enough to fit in the lunchbox
- Portable Power Bank 25000mAh(Amazon)

Everything is self explanatory and there are tons of videos that will help you put this together.
However, this is how I put it together:

You want to do a rough draft of how everything is going to fit inside the lucnbox, so place everything in 
on how you want it to be displayed. Once you decided on your final look of the lunchbox install the 
"LCD Module Screen" first, I had to punch holes in my tin luncbox with a screw driver. If you have any other tools
use them. Then i hooked up all the necessary cords to my Raspberry Pi B+ and turned it on.(My Raspberry Pi B+ was already setup
from my previous class I took in college, so you will need to start from scratch and look at youtube videos)

###Installing OpenCV, Dlib, & Facial Recognition using PYTHON
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*WARNING*
*PAY ATTENTION TO WHICH VERSION OF PYTHON YOU ARE USING IN ORDER TO INSTALL ALL OF THESE, IT MATTERS A LOT*
*PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE YOU INSTALL THESE PACKAGES*
*YOU CAN RUN THE CODE WITHIN YOUR TERMINAL OR PYTHON IDLE*

*DO'S & DONTS*
Do take your time it is not a race, when you rush you will have errors. No one likes errors and can be frustrating
Do watch & follow every step of these videos! One small mishap and you can have an error.
Do have fun! After completing everything you will feel so accomplished!

Don't pay for anything, no subscriptions or tutors. I found out that there are so many different people who are charging for
the steps needed to take while there are the same exact steps for free on youtube and other sites. All you need to do is to be able
to know exactly what you need help with and Google will find it.
